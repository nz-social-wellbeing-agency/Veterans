# Veterans
This is the collection of code used to produce and summarise datasets relating to our work on New Zealand's veterans.

The final report is available here: https://www.sia.govt.nz/assets/Document-Library/Building-an-evidence-base-for-understanding-veteran-outcomes-Final-for-publication-v2.pdf

An A3 summary can be found here: https://www.sia.govt.nz/assets/Document-Library/Veteran-population-A3.pdf

# Dependencies
It is necessary to have an IDI project if you wish to run the code. Visit the Stats NZ website for more information about this.

This analysis has been developed for the IDI_Clean_202210 refresh of the IDI. As changes in database structure can occur between refreshes, some updating may be needed to run the
code in other refreshes. This code also reads and writes to a project-specific sandpit tables. It will be necessary for others to change these project references when running the code.
The code was developed with regards to the needs of this particular project, and may need revision before being used in other projects.
